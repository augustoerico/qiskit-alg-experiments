# Quiskit Algorithms Experiments

This projects is a Work in Progress. It intends to serve as a test bed to support my Master's thesis, but eventually it will become a tool so other researchers may conduct their own experiments.

The idea is to run and compare the quantum circuit execution results in 2 scenarios: ideal (StateVector) and noisy simulation. Once it achieves certain maturity, I'll begin tests on real quantum HW.
